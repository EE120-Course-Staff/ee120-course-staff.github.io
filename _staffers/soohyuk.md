Hi all! I'm SooHyuk, a junior double majoring CS and DS. I'm from Seoul, South Korea. This is my first time teaching EE 120 so I'm super excited :)) I was previously on course staff for EECS 16A for four semesters beforehand. My technical interests include various aspects of Hardware/Software Co-Design, computer architecture & system, and robotics & control. I like playing the piano in my free time unless I'm stuck in the library lol. Any recommendations for classical or new age piano pieces are always welcome! Please feel free to reach out for anything :)) Looking forward to another amazing semester! Hope you'd enjoy this course as much as (and more than) I did!
