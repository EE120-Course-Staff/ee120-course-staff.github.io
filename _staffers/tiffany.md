Hello! I'm a 5th-year PhD student working with Laura. My research is on algorithms for 3D electron microscopy of atoms in materials, especially when the sample you're trying to look at is changing over time. The reason I got into computational imaging was because of signals and systems! One of my favorite facts is that lenses (in optics) perform physical Fourier transforms. I also enjoy arts and crafts, climbing, and my cat Meatball.
