Hello! I'm a 5th-year PhD student working with Laura. My research is on algorithms for atomic 3D electron microscopy of materials, especially when the sample you're trying to look at is changing over time. One of my favorite facts is that lenses in optics perform physical Fourier transforms! I also have a cat named Meatball.
