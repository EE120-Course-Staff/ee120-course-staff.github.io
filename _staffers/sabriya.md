Hi! I’m Sabriya, a PhD student in Computer Science, researching artificial intelligence and human-computer interaction. Signals and Systems was one of my favorite courses as an undergrad, and I’m excited to help make this semester a meaningful and fun learning experience. Outside of academics, I love reading, writing, volunteering, and experimenting with new recipes! Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions about the course, or if you’d just like to chat about research, career paths, or graduate school.
