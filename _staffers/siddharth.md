Hi all! I’m Sidd, a third-year EECS major from New Delhi, India. I love playing just about any sport you can think of and trying different cuisines over the weekend. This is my first semester on the EE 120 team so I’m pretty ecstatic :) I hope to give y’all a great semester! Looking forward to meeting you in-person soon!
