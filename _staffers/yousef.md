Hi, my name is Yousef and I am a senior transfer in EECS. I am from the Bay Area/Egypt, and am looking forward to being a TA for EE120 this semester (this will be my third time)! Some of the stuff I like to do in my free time include playing soccer (my favorite club is Liverpool), tinkering with my car, and I have also started taking flight lessons recently. I'm looking forward to meeting all of you, and please reach out if you would like to talk about anything at all!
