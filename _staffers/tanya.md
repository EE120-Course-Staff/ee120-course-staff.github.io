Hi! I am Tanya, a third-year PhD student in EECS. I am working with Prof. Chunlei Liu on magnetic resonance imaging. In my free time, I like watching k-dramas (my favorite k-drama is Descendants of the Sun), drawing and painting (especially flowers) and doing shopping :) This is my first time TA-ing for this class and I am super excited about it!
